# SZiM
SZiM is a UNIX citation manager written in BASH. The goal is
to create a simple system like pass to manage a collection of .bib and .pdf
files on disk. Synchronisation will be possible through git.

**SZiM is in development state but mostly stable. Download feature only works for mathematic literature, as of now.**
